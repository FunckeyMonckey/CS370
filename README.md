In this project we were giving the basis of a game and the mechanic on how it runs and how it is won. We created a way for an AI to learn how to beat the game, by having it make random moves which were giving a score based of each move until it reached the goal. After repeating this over and over, the AI learn which moves would result in a higher score, after each score the program would count it as a win or loss. The system would continue until the AI gained a 100% win rate.

## $Computer scientists use code to create systems and programs that help aid humans by delegating work to a computer that can effectively produce correct results in a fast manner. Problems are viewed by computer scientist by first looking at the goal or result the problems wants or can get, and finding a means for a computer to get tha result. Then you ensure that the system is accurate in solving the problem, and wont run into issues if certain events occur (known or unknown). The ethical responsibility of computer scientists is very big, you must realize the capabilities programs and systems can achieve and what impact these major results can have on the population. Withut looking at the ethical side of a program, systems would be used in a manner that can damages others in various ways.$
